this project was an experience for me to learn firebase, and more complex ui design, this is still a wip however the loin system is funcional and the design (in my opinion) is really cool

on the home page you can scroll down to learn more, click about to learn about me and the project, and click login to be sent to the login screen

there you can create an account and then login with said account to be redirected to the main page where i am still currently working on the to do list part of the site. 

overall even though this project is still a wip  i hope you enjoy checking out the site and how the project is doing!
